# Diploma JAVA Assignment 2
Game inventory application

One of my biggest and proudest work.
It was my second semester and I had the stupidest idea of following up the success of Java assignment 1.
How much fun would it be to turn the whole console based applicated to a full proper GUI based application in a week.
Yes dealine was a week away, so it was 1 week of no sleep. Literally.

Till this day I still talk about this craziness to my group  partner.
